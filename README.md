**Integrated Hybrid Quantum-Classical AI Framework (v1.0)**

## 🚀 Overview
This repository implements a modular 2030-era Quantum AI architecture. It utilizes a distributed system of protocols synchronized by a master controller to process data in Hilbert space.


## 🛠 System Architecture
The framework is divided into four critical layers:

* **Foundation (`quantum_hello.py`)**: Implements Superposition, allowing the AI to explore multiple data states simultaneously.
* **Data Link (`quantum_entanglement.py`)**: Establishes "Spooky Action" (Entanglement) between qubits for non-local data synchronization.
* **The Neuron (`quantum_vqc.py`)**: A Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) that acts as the AI's processing unit using tunable rotation gates.
* **The Conductor (`main_quantum_ai.py`)**: The Master Controller that initializes the environment, establishes links, and runs the integrated AI workflow.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Quantum Framework:** IBM Qiskit
* **Simulation Environment:** Aer Qasm Simulator
